### Installation
I will skip in dept documentation for the application and I will include the same steps in the [forkapi docs](https://mikebgrep.github.io/forkapi/Installation/)

With this `docker-compose.yml` you can deploy the app together with the backend on a local machine or Rasberry Pi.
```
TODO://
```

##### Steps
1. Download the `.env` file and  make sure all variables are populated (hint sneek peek into the official [docs](https://mikebgrep.github.io/forkapi/Installation/) page if you are not sure what a variable do ü§î)

2. Choice the right image for you host.

3. If you want ssl support you need to map the folder path to the ssl in the container to your local `pem` and `cert` files location. Is should look like in the `docker-compose.yml` file on line `ToDo`
`-YOUR_PATH/SSL_FOLDER:/forkcrecipes/ssl`

4. Last but not least run the docker compose command
``` bash
$ docker compose up
```

5. You are all set.

##### Recap
This will setup 3 Docker container on the host one is the `Nginx` webserver that comunicate with the other two container one for the BE Api `forkapi` and one for the front end `fork.recipes` application
You can access the API admin panel on `host:80/admin` or port 443 if you using ssl and the `host:80` for the fork.recipes application.
